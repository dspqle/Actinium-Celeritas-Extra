/**
 * Drives authoritative particle discovery off the GUI and off the per-particle hot path.
 * <p>
 * In 1.12.2 {@code Minecraft.effectRenderer} is (re)created per world load, and that is when
 * vanilla and most mod particle factories are present. We therefore run the reflection scan once
 * per {@code effectRenderer} instance (detected on the client tick, which is robust to the
 * world-load ordering). Results are persisted as a refreshable cache so previously discovered
 * particles — including lambda/anonymous mod particles, which can only be found at spawn time —
 * appear from launch on later sessions; stale entries from removed mods are pruned on each scan.
