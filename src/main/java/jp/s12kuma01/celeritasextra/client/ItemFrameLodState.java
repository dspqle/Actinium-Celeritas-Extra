 * While a framed item is farther than the configured distance, {@link #active} is set for the duration
 * of that frame's content render. The RenderItem / ForgeHooksClient mixins consult
 * {@link #filterLodQuads} to drop the four side faces of the held 3D (block) model, keeping only the
 * front/back faces the viewer can actually see through the frame — this cuts the vertices submitted for
 * far-away framed block items. Flat sprite items have nothing to cull and are left untouched; maps are
 * handled separately (culled at the same distance in MixinRenderItemFrame).
 * <p>
 * Client render thread only, so a plain static flag is safe without synchronization.
